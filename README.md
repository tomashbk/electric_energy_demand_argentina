(This is still a work in progress)

This project is to analyze the electric demand in Argentina and to make a Time Series Forecast model that could predict 12 months forward.

- `eda.ipynb` is the analysis of the Time series.
- `SARIMAX.ipynb` is where we start to use the SARIMAX model approach to discover which combination of parameters performs the best. We attempt to find them manually and also with pmdarima (http://alkaline-ml.com/pmdarima/).
- `machine_learning.ipynb` is where we explore the combination of different machine learning models.
